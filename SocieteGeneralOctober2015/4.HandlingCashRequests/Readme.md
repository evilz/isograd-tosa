# Handling cash requests

## Objective

When a cash dispenser handles a cash request, a classical method is to provide in priority the largest note then to provide smaller notes to cover the rest of the request and to continue like this until the request is filled. 

Example : if the request is $190 and the cash dispenser has $100, $50, $20, and $10 notes, the cash dispenser will provide a $100 note and a $50 note and 2 $20 notes.

In this challenge, you will be provided with a cash request and the list of available notes and you will have to determine the notes that the dispenser provides according to the above algorithm. You can assume that the dispenser has a sufficient quantity of each notes to fill the withdrawal.

The challenge will not use realistic data, notes can have value like 12311 and the withdrawal can be very high.

## Data Format

**Input**
Row 1 : an integer between 1 and 100,000 representing the amount that you have to deliver.
Row 2 : an integer N representing the number of types of notes that the cash dispenser can use.
Row 3 to N+2 : an integer between 1 and 50,000 representing the face values of the notes that are available. The notes are sorted ascendingly.

You can assume that the dispenser will always hold the right notes to match the withdrawal.

**Output**

A series of pairs of integers Xi and Yi separated by a space. For each type of note used to fill the order, Xi represents the number of notes of value Yi that you want to deliver. The pairs have to be sorted in descending order of Yi. If we take the example above, the output would be :

```
1 100 1 50 2 20
```
