# Card number validation

## Objective

In this challenge, you need to determine if a card number is valid. A card number includes 16 digits:
- The first 6 correspond to the issuing bank,
- 9 digits are taken randomly,
- the last digit is the Luhne key

The Luhne key is based on the first 15 digits. One digit out of two is multiplied by 2 starting with the first one. If the result is greater than 9 then 9 is deduced from the result. This provides a new series of digits. The Luhne key is the value that needs to be added to this sum to get a number that can be divided by 10.
Example: 5295 4648 5201 3672 

By adding the Luhne Key (last digit of the card number), which is 2, to this sum 68, you get the number 70, which is a multiple of 10. Therefore, this is a valid card.
